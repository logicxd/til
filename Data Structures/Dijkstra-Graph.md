# Dijsktra's All Shortest Path Algorithm

Given a starting node and a graph, it computes the shortest paths to all the nodes that can be reached in the graph.
It computes just the cost for all the shortest paths but omits information for reconstructing the paths.
* Directed graph.
* Edges are weighted (non-negative values); they have some value.
* The length of a path is the sum-of-the-weights of all edges on the path.

# Extended Dijsktra (Pattis Edition)

Dijsktra plus additional information for reconstructing the path.

Most data is stored as `Info` class
* Contains the cost of the minimum path to reach that node from starting node.
  * Initialized to +infinity.
* The name of the current node (should be initialized at the start).
* The name of the node BEFORE it on the shortest path.
  * Initialized to '?'.

`distGraph` is the graph contains information for all the nodes and their edges.
    This is the information that is provided for the dijkstra to use.

There are three collections that are used two Maps and a Priority Queue.
A graph `distGraph` that contains information for all the nodes and edges is to be provided which
is the information that dijkstra uses.
* `answer_map` is a map with key `string` to hold the node name, and value `Info`.
    This map holds the shortest path from the starting node to any given node.
    Contains nodes whose minimum distance IS KNOWN.
* `info_map` is a map with key `string` to hold the node name, and value `Info`.
    This map holds the unexplored nodes in the graph.
    Contains nodes whose minimum distance IS NOT YET KNOWN.
* `info_pq` is a min-heap priority queue that contains a list of `Info`.
    This is used to determine the next node to visit based on the lowest cost.


Basic Algorithm:
```
1) Prompt the user for a file name and load and print its graph, whose edges
     are labeled by non-negative integer values.

2) Prompt the user to enter a start node.

3) Call the extended_dijkstra function with this information, returning a map
     of the minimum costs to reach each node and the information needed to
     construct its path.

   In the extended_dijkstra function:

   3a) Declare the answer_map to be empty and the info_map to contain each node
         in the graph as a key in the map and the value as a new Info that is initialized
         to contain the name of the node.

       Update the start node in the info_map by setting its total_cost to 0
          (since we start at that node, the cost to reach it is 0).

   Note the info_map contains nodes whose minimum distance from the start node
   IS NOT YET KNOWN; the answer_map contains nodes whose minimum distance IS
   KNOWN.

   3b) Declare the info_pq, and load it with all the contents in info_map
        : here the smallest cost has the highest priority.

   3c) Loop so long as the info_map is not empty...

       3c1) Remove the Info from info_pq with the smallest associated cost
              -initally the start node.
            If its cost is infinity, then no more nodes in info_map are
              reachable, so terminate.
            If its node is already in answer_map, skip this node.

       3c2) Call "min_node" the node from this Info and "min_cost" its cost. We
              are now guaranteed to know the least costly path from the start
              node to min_node.

       3c3) Remove "min_node" from the info_map and put it into answer_map

       3c4) For every node d that is a destination from the min_node and not
              already in the answer_map.

              (1) Get d's Info using info_map
              (2) if the cost is infinite or greater than the cost of the path from
                    the start node to min_node plus the cost of the edge from
                    min_node to d.

                    (a) In info_map for d, update the cost in Info to this smaller number,
                    and update the predecessor of d to be min_node.
                    (b) Add the updated Info to the info_pq.

        3c5) Repeat the info_pq loop.

  3d) When the loop finishes, the Info values in answer_map are filled with
        the minimum cost to reach each node and the node preceding it on the
        minimum path. Return this information.

4) Repeatedly prompt the user for a stop node and show the minimum cost and
     minimum cost path to reach that node, by calling the recover_path, which
     returns a Queue of the nodes on the shortest path between the start node
     and stop node.

   By repeatedly following the predecessors in the map (a Stack is useful here),
     we can reconstruct a queue containing the entire minimimum cost path, from
     the start node to any reachable node.
