# Equivalence Relations

Any equivalence relation (R) has the following three properties

1. Reflexivity: a R a
2. Symmetry: a R b implies b R a
3. transitivity: a R b, and b R c implies a R c.

These are specifically useful for some graph theories.

Fundamentally three basic operations that we can perform on equivalence relations/equivalence classes

1. Add a new value to the equivalence, starting in its own equivalence classes
2. Determine whether or not two values are in the same equivalence classes
3. Merge the equivalence classes of two values, creating one equivalence class
containing all the values in each of the equivalence classes: all those values are now equivalent.
