# Information Retrieval(IR)
Information is knowledge about a particular subject, issue, event or process.

## Web Search Engine
* Scalability.
* No incentive in creating content unless it can be found.
* Better categorization and filtering.
* Search interaction makes "unlimited selection" stores possible.

# IR Architecture

Web Graph
* The Web is a graph.
* Pages are nodes.
* Hyperlinks are directed edges. `->`

Spiders & Indexes
* Instead of searching through the actual pages, it searches through the indexes.
* Indexes are pointers to the actual pages.
* Spider searches through the indexes.

Web Characteristics
* Huge.
* Changes all the time.
* Information to avoid (spam).
* One interface for hugely divergent needs.
* Significant duplications.
* High linkage: more than 8 links per page.

Evolution of the Web
* Static pages have fixed content that is the same every time you visit it.
* Dynamic pages mostly ignored by web spiders
  * Too much to index.
  * Spider traps.
* User-generated content (Web 2.0)
  * Javascript and single-page Web applications.
* Mobile: HTTP without Web browsers.
