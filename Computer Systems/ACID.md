# ACID
A property that is an acronym for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. For any transaction in the database (or anywhere applicable that has the ACID property).

* **Atomicity**: Each transaction is all or nothing.
* **Consistency**: Each transaction moves the database from one consistent state to another one.
* **Isolation**: Each transaction can be written as if it's the only transaction in existence.
* **Durability**: Once a transaction has committed, its effects will not be lost. Don't have to worry about data loss).
