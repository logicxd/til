# Permutations and Combinatorics

All possible ways that an event can occur.

## Permutations

An arrangement of objects in a definite order. Order matters. No repetition.

In how many ways can we select r many objects from a total of n many to choose from.

Let `A` be an event from a sample space `S`.
* #(A) denotes the number of ways event A can occur.
* #(S) denotes the number of possible outcomes(number of elements in the sample space)
* `P(A) = #(A)/#(S)`

Double check these. Compare with discrete math notes.
`Pn,r`: Out of the total amount n, select r amount for permutation.
* `Pn,r: n!/(n-r)!`

## Combinations

A selection of objects without regard to order. Order doesn't matter. No repetition.

Select r many objects from a total of n possible objects, where order does not matter.
* `Cn,r: (n r) = n!/r!(n-r)!`

## Permutations vs Combinations

You can have more possible ways for a permutation than for a combination.

## Counting

Permutation with repetition.
