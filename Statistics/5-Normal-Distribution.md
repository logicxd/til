# Normal Distribution
Useful if we have a large amount of data and we want to figure out the distribution.

## Keywords
* Mew μ - determines the center of the curve, the mean. `E(x) = μ`.
* sigma σ - determines the steepness of the curve.

* **Standard normal distribution** is centered at mean of 0. (The peak is at (0,y)).
* **Regular normal distribution** can be anywhere in the x-axis.

Z (slide 9, lecture 10)
* todo:

Alpha (will be on the test)
* You pick the σ.
* Need the area under the curve between -z and z to be 1 - alpha.
* Will need the area above z to be alpha / 2 (so the area below is 1 - alpha / 2).

## Central Limit Theorem
* Z = (Xbar - μ) / (alpha / sqrt(n)).
* Xbar is your data.
* n is your sample size.

Confidence Interval (CI)
* (Xbar - 1.96 (sigma / sqrt(n), Xbar + 1.96 (sigma / sqrt(n))) = `(l,u)` lower and upper.
* "We are 90% confident the true mew is in the interval (l,u)"

Test Question
* Create a confidence interval and define it. (Don't use probability, use confidence interval).
