# Statistics

**Law of Large Numbers**: if some experiment has been tried for a very large number of times,
the probability will converge to the true probability of a single success.

**Bayesian probability**: a probability that is based on beliefs or knowledge, not based on
the number of trails or tests.
Ex: There's a 99% chance that I will perform well on MCAT (Number of times: 0)

**Frequentist probability**: a probability that is based on known knowledge of collected data.
Ex: There's a 99% chance that I will be on time for work (Number of times: 1000)

## Set Theory

**Sample space**: the set of all possible outcomes in a random experiment.
Ex: Roll a pair of dice. Then, `S = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ... , (6,5), (6,6)}`.
Or also S = `{(x,y) : x = 1,2,...,5,6, y = 1,2,...,5,6}`.

**Event (sample point)**: a subset of the sample space. An empty set is also an event.
Ex: The event A can be the event that the number the die lands on is greater than 4. Therefore A = {5,6}.

The empty set ∅ is also an event.

## Probability

**Probability distribution**: denoted as P( ). Follows these set of rules
* `0 < P(s) <= 1 for all s ∈ S`.
* `The sum of P(s) for all s ∈ S = 1`.

## Set Theory Basics

**Mutually Exclusive**: Two sets cannot occur at the same time. `A ∩ B = ∅`

## Probability Theory Basics

Some axions:
* `P(S) = 1`
* `If A ⊆ B then P(A) ≤ P(B)`
* `P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)`
* `P (A) + P (Ac ) = 1`
