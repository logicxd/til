As [LukeN](http://stackoverflow.com/users/280656/luken) says

### How do we parse [JSON](https://github.com/AlaricGonzales/til/blob/Alaric/iOS/JSON.md)?

* Example 1: By iterating, using `objectForKey:`, and many `if-else` statements

```
Insert code here for parsing without libraries
```

* Example 2: By using a mapping library

```
Insert usage of RPJSONMapper
```

* Example 3: By using a different mapping library

```
Insert usage of other JSON mapping library
```
