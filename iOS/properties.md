#Properties

#####What are properties?
Properties are variables that belong to a class.

#####Where would you define them?

Suppose you're defining the class for a Person

```
// Person.h

@interface Person : NSObject

@end

```
The properties of this person are defined in the Person interface, 
indicating the attributes of the property and what type of object this property defines.

```
// Person.h

@interface Person : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSInteger *currentAge;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSInteger *birthdayYear;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSInteger *firstName;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSInteger *lastName;

- (void)fullName;
@end
```
*What's happening?*
- ```@property``` is just the way properties are first declared
- ```(nonatomic, strong)``` These are the attributes (settings, in other words) of the property. By default, 
properties are atomic, which is thorough and ensures the getter will be completed, however often seen as too slow.
  *  This is why we often indicate that we want our object to have a ```nonatomic``` setting, 
we want things to be done fast and efficient *enough*. 
  * ```strong``` means the object will exist as long as the reference of the object is held. This is a default attribute.
  * ```copy``` indicates that the object is copied so modifications don't affect others.

####How would you make use of these Properties?

You would make use of these properties as you are implementing your methods in ```Person.m```.
  * Again, recall that properties are just variables that you can use 
  to define features of an object with a certain type of class.

```
// Person.m
@implementation Person
- (void) fullName {
    NSLog(@"What's cookin, %@", self.firstName);
  }
@end
```
In this example, I'm making the fullName method log "What's cookin " and whatever object I used firstName to define.

So, if I wrote the following in main:

```
Person *myName = [[Person alloc] init];

myName.firstName = @"Banana";

[myName fullName];

```

The output would be "What's cookin banana".

*What's happening in the above code?*
* ```Person *myName = [[Person alloc] init];``` I'm allocating space for an object in class Person and I'm indicating that 
it'll be initialized with something.

* ```myName.firstName = @"Banana";``` I'm saying that myName will have the firstName property, 
which will be of the string "Banana".

* ```[myName fullName];``` Now, I'm sending the ```fullName``` message (or method) to the ```myName``` object,
which means the ```fullName``` will run and use my definition of firstName.



#Getters, Setters, and Instance Variables

Properties will generate a **Getter**, **Setter**, and **Instance Variable**.

####The Getter
* This is an *accessor method* that gets called every time you read a value from a property, and whatever that method returns is considered 
that property's value.
* So, if I were to declare a property: ```@property NSNumber *someNumber = 21;```, accessing ```someNumber``
is achieved by using a **getter**.
* **Getters**, by convention, are given the same name as the property.
  * Example: The getter method of ```@property(nonatomic, strong) NSNumber *myBirthday;``` is ```myBirthday```

####The Setter
* This is an *accessor method* that gets called every time you change the value of a property.
* **Setters**, by convention, are given the name of the property prefixed by "```set```" and suffixed by "```:```".
  * Example: The setter method of ```@property(nonatomic, strong) NSNumber *myBirthday;``` is ```setMyBirthday:```
* If you do not want the **setter** to change ```myBirthday```, you would have to define the property with the ```readonly``` 
attribute. The property by default is defined with a ```readwrite``` attribute.

####Instance Variables
* Instance variables are generated by the compiler if the property is set to ```readwrite``` (which is already set by default).

  * These variables hold their value for the life of the object. When the first object is created (through ```alloc```),
the memory used for the instance variable is allocated, and then freed when the object is deallocated.

  * Instance variables, by convention, are given the same name of the property prexied by an underscore ```_```
  
**How do you access Instance Variables?**
* Instance variables are accessed directly in the implementation of any of the methods the instance variable belongs to.

[Useful Explanation of Instance Variables & Usage](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-an-instance-variable-in-objective-c)

* The **setter** takes an object of the property's defined class as a parameter and changes the instance variable to be that object.


```
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// Person.h
@interface Person : NSObject

@property(nonatomic, strong) NSString *firstName;

- (void) fullName;

@end

// Person.m
@implementation Person

- (void) fullName {
    NSLog(@"What's cookin %@", _firstName);
}

@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        Person *myName = [[Person alloc] init];
        [myName setFirstName:@"Herro"];
        [myName fullName];
    }
    return 0;
}
```
*What's happening? [2]*

* ```@property(nonatomic, strong) NSString *firstName;```  Declaring ```*firstName``` as an object of type ```NSString```
as a property for Person.


``` 
-(void) fullName {
    NSLog(@"What's cookin %@", _firstName);
    
}
``` 
* This is implementing the ```fullName``` to make it print "What's cookin" with an **instance** of ```firstName```.

```
[myName setFirstName:@"Herro"];

[myName fullName];
``` 

* This is using the **setter** of ```firstName``` to set the **instance** **variable** ```_firstName``` to "Herro",
  then sending the **getter** method ```fullName``` to ```myName```, which reads the value of ```myName``` and returns whatever 
  value ```myName``` is.
